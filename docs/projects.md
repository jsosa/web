## System-Risk

>a large scale systems approach to flood risk assessment and management

I'm part of the System-Risk project a Marie-Sk≈Çodowska-Curie European Training Network which
aims to develop and implement a systems approach for large scale flood risk assessment and management.

This project funded my PhD and I contributed to the development of tools to map flood risk at large scale and high resolution. 
Within the project I created [LFPtools](https://github.com/jsosa/LFPtools), 
a Python library to quickly prepare flood inundation models worldwide. I created the **EUFLOOD** framework, a Python framework 
to map riverine flooding in any basin in Europe. I'm the lead author of **EUFLOOD-REA**, a project which combines LFPtools and EUFLOOD to reconstruct 
riverine flooding in Europe. I'm the lead author of **EUFLOOD-HAZ**, a project which analyse European past flood events from a 
flood hazard/risk perspective. I collaborated on the creation of 
[MERIT Hydro](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_Hydro), a high-resolution global hydrography map based 
on latest topography datasets.
