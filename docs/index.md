# About

<center><img src="dat/sosaphoto.png" width="150"></center>

I'm a Marie Curie PhD Fellow under the [System-Risk](https://system-risk.eu/) project working at the University of Bristol's [Hydrology Group](http://www.bris.ac.uk/geography/research/hydrology/)
in the School of Geographical Sciences. I hold an MSc in Environmental Fluid Mechanics from the Universite Grenoble Alpes and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from the Universidad San Francisco de Quito.

My Research interests are global meteorology, hydrological modelling, hydrodynamic modelling, flooding, remote sensing, ocean wave modelling, coastal engineering, cloud computing, big data, data analysis and data visualization.

I've worked in geoscience research for more than nine years. I have expertise on large datasets at global-scale (NOAA-GFS, Era-Interim, ESA-GlobWave, Landsat, Sentinels) geo formats (GeoTIFF, NetCDF, GRIB) programming languages (Python, Matlab, Fortran, C++, learning Node.js), big data geosciences portals ([Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), [Pangeo](http://pangeo-data.org/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)) and workflow automation & orchestration.

Currently, I'm working on the development of tools to map flood risk across Europe at high resolution employing a hydrological-hydraulic modelling chain.
